# Georgia Salaries

I like reading the poem of the day on [poetryfoundation.org](poetryfoundation.org). 

This year (2023), I really enjoyed the [poem posted on tax day](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/40511/sex-and-taxes), by Kevin Cantwell.

*The goose-neck glare undoes how we spent the day. /
Each bite each bee-sting kiss each bitten O / 
all aftertaste. Later, at the drop-off, / 
postmark queue, we joke: "Now we can die!"*

I googled Mr. Cantwell to see if he published any other poetry I might enjoy. 

I don't remember if I found any other poems by him, but I do remember finding out he's a professor at a public university in Georgia. 
Being the nosy guy that I am, I tried to find his salary using [Georgia's public database](https://open.ga.gov/openga/salaryTravel/index) (hey, if Data Science doesn't work out, I'd like to know what other careers are out there). 

I won't sugarcoat it: Georgia's salary database website stinks. It's a cumbersome process to find a state employee. 
Every year for which you want to access salary data requires a new search, and you won't find the employee your looking for if you don't know which organization they belong to.

I went to ASU, where former students put together a [great salary website](https://www.statepress.com/article/2017/04/spinvestigative-salary-database)

I figured I could build a better site for Georgia's salaries, so I did!

Try using the [original site](https://open.ga.gov/openga/salaryTravel/index) side by side with [my version](https://georgiasalaries.onrender.com) and let me know what you think!
